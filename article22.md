	The day started off with installing the flutter i have forgot some of the things that needs to be installedfor the flutter to work and realised that flutter wont work without installing android studio and there were some more issue installing the android studio setup completely and  i googled some more methods to install the android studio properly and then also it was not proper and ameen helped me solving the problem as there were issues with the path .After lunch there were some more problems identified by ameen and he helped me to solve the problems and made flutter work in my laptop.The main problem with my case is that SDK(Software Development Kit) was not found in the android studio which i installed and the following happened.
	I left to surfboard because i have to create the language as it was the given task by kaushik yesterday.I need to have discussions with my team and i had some more discuissions and had some more ideas on how to create a new language with some letter,Numericals and operators.
	Then there was today session where we were taught  what is language and how it is framed.In programming language symbols are taken from the UNICODE which is letters from all the language from the world in that english is chosen and programming languages are built using english and we learnt what are tokens,They are the identifiers,operators,punctuators,num literals,string literals.The expressions are a combo of tokens.we learnt the types of keywords like async,throw,catch,const,extend,int,string,boolean etc.We learnt that what are datatypes in the programming languages such as javascript and dart.It is nothing but the type of data we given.There are two types of datatypes they are primitive datatypes and composite datatypes.
The primitive datatypes is nothing but the string,int,bool,double,float.The composite datatypes are nothing but the array,objects and functions.
I learnt that array is nothing but the lists.Objects is nothing but the inputs we give inside the {} are said to be objects.
The function is nothing but add,sub etc these are the exampls of functions.We learnt the syntax of these like int a = 5;In this the int is the datatype, a is the identifer,= is the assiging operator,5 is the num literal and ; is the sentence terminator.Programming language is nothing but the collection of the above mentioned things  but in the correct form and correct syntax.Today i had a clear idea on what a programming language actually is.Hopefully tomorrow ill be even more productive.
