	The started off with me recalling the things which i had learned in the previous week ,There was a session from the morning itself as it will be the last week of our intern they have started the intern in the morning itself.We were recalled about the topics of the last week,like variables,objects,array,datatype.We were given some sort of  examples to get clear in those topics above,like they jumbled the syntax and we have to form the correct syntax.From these those topics were clear.After that we were given a program and told to find the output of that,and continuing with that we were give many types of program and were asked to find the output of those programs.By doing so we learnt the flow of the program.What actually happens when we type codes,and how it is executed internally.After that we started with the topic called the class.A class is nothing but a blueprint,it is used to plan the program.The class contains two types in it,they are the properties and the function of a class.The class is used to as two thingsit is used as blueprintit is used for the security,to safeguard the data or information in it.When we open a class a constructor is created .I learnt that when name=name;It is the terminalogy and it is called the shadowing problem.To eliminate that,they brought a keyword called "this" in it.I learnt what is execution stack,a stack is nothing but piling something one on top of the other.The same in execution stacking,the execution part alone keeps stacking till the end of the part of the execution.The main function is a primary one where in any programming language ,first the main part is executed.After that it goes to the children and so on.
	The main function has children example,add function is a children of main.If add has another fucntion like sub or mul,then it is called the child of the add.The main is the parent class of all.When their is function called add inside the main,when it is called for the add function,then it goes the add part and executes whats inside that,Once everything inside the add part is executed,then it comes out  of that block,called the block of the add.After all these explanations Kaushik gave us some overview on what frameworks is,language and database.Framesworks is nothing but a tool for us to build a app or a web page etc.A language is nothing but a language used to create the code.The database is nothing but the data we store to access.Their is front end and backend the different between them is nothing,but they use different frameworks and languages.Literally nothing other than that.In frontend we used to create the user interface for the app or a webpage etc.In user interface their are 4 or 5 interactive they are touch,command line,buttons,click .We learnt  what is meant by api.It is nothing but the application progamming interface.It is used almost used in many codes but for example,api is used in weather forcaste application.When we request for that api ,it responce it with the result.Then they informed us about the projects that we need to present on our final day of internship which is on friday,we were divided into groups and was alloted some topics to work on for the remaining days of the internship program.Kaushik also informed us that todays session will be the last one for the internship.Hopefully we can give our best in the projects that we were assigned in .
