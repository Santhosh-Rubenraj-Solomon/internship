	The day started off by correcting the mistakes that surfboard people suggested me to do .There were some major correction about the placement of the profile icon so it was changed in the whole applications and there were some places where difference in the drop down box as it was not even and i had to change those things in the design of the application.There were some more corrections upon the user login and the sign up procedures which had to be changed in order to make it more simpler.Those were the major corrections which was given to me those things were corrected and there were some minor corrections of the font style and the alignments which was taken care and corrected.
	I was assigned with a task of downloading the flutter into my laptop and to check on how to work on the flutter setup.I was trying to download the flutter in my laptop and still trying then there was a group dicussion where we tend to create a language with our own .I had some different assumptions and created a language by swaping the letters so that it looked different.It was later realised that it must not be done that way and then we sat and created a laguage in 2 mins which was not used and we were given one more day time to build a language .   
	After that we went to the session,we were told to present the language assignment we were given.I learnt how a search engine works when we ask it for something in any language.It has three analysis phase"Lexical analysis,Syntatical analysis and Sematical analysis".Finally in enters to the code which is code generator.It analize our input and checks its for the correct formation and then sends it to the next step which is syntatical analysis.It checks the sentence formation of the given input if it have some meaning to it ,it is send to the third one which is sematical analysis.It checks the meaning the given input and finally send to the code genertor.It genrates the code and fetch us what we are requested.After that we learnt that english have noun,verb etc.Same as a programming language.Its just a other language we have to look it in that perspective.So that  we have to understand its symbols, tokens,expressions,rules etc to communicate with the computer.As i said in english we have noun etc same in programming language but in a different word they are "int,bool,string" etc. hopefully  i will be more productive tomorrow.
