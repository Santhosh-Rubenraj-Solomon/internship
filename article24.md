	The day started off with learning the basuc of flutter where i was taught the basic tempelate on how to decode an application and to code that so that i can get the required output.After the basic concepts were taught i was given a task to decode a random page from a random application from dribble where i was able to decode the given page and it was interesting as we must decode the given page so that after the completing the coding we will get the required output as an applicatiion.Later i was given a task to decode the application which i have designed for the library management system in surfboard i was able to decode two pages in it which was very useful for me to get familiar with the things which will be important for me to  develop th application.
	Then there was todays session where Kaushik recalled the things which he took throughout this week which  was helpful for us.we learnt that translator is also one type of a compiler.What is a compiler?It is nothing but the combination of lexical analysis,syntatical analysis,sematic analysis.When we search for something in the internet ,our search query is validated by these steps.If any of these steps fail then it is called as the compile time error.once again we learnt that the algorithms are the root of a code or anything.So it very important.The first three are called the compiler.After the compiler there is a another step called the code generation.Where the code is converted into the machine level language.Which is 01.Because the computers can understand only 01.What ever we code finally it is made to 01 .
then we  learnt what is an  assembly level language.It is nothing but the combination of the both 01 and the arithmetics like the add,sub,mul.div,move etc.In the early stage only computers printed the 01 after that the assembly level language for created.After that the compilers where created.We type the code in english,we use the compilers to change the language from human level to the machine level.
	After that we were taken to turf where it was fun playing .This week was productive than last week as i gained more knowledge on how to present and took some of the suggestion so that i can improve the features in my application,Hopefully the forth coming week will be even more productive that this one .
