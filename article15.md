	The day started off by improvising the last weeks design and completing the required pages to make the users side application presentable.There were some suggestions from ameen bro on how to make the appliication work more on solving the problem exactly and I was getting inputs from ameen as to how to think about the requirements on the admins side of the application as it was some more complex than the users side of the application .The logic on how to get the data from the users side of the application was little bit on the complex side which requires me to improve my standards in my thinking so as to make the application useful and friendly on the admins version as well . Todays task given to me by my mentor was to complete the users side of the application clearly so that i can get the clear requirement on the things which will be needed to update on the admins version to get more user freiendly setup while using the application practically. The purpouse is to solve the problem as simple and as efficient as possible. Then i was said that i must present my users side application in front of others on wednesday and i must prepare an ppt tomorrow so that i can present it on wednesday in surfboard.Icame home early as we were granted permission today to take rest as most of the boys travelled all night and they were tried and i had some time today at home where i refreshed myself had some chitchats and started to continue with the extreme ownership which i was not studying in the last week and i completed some portion of the extreme ownership and started to explore some more designs where i can get som more ideas and it may help in getting even more better ideas,logics to  solve the problem on the admins version of application.
	Now i will be workinng on the tasks which i had to complete today and to think some more in order to solve the problems which i took which can be helpful not only in the surfboard but also when done better can be even developed into a different ideas in the future .So i hope that today was helpful with the suggestions from my mentor and ameen bro which i can implement their suggestions in the near  future.
