	The day started off with me having an idea of designing a proper application as a beginner and i had some inputs from my mentor which i corrected.After the users application design i wrote down the basic requirements in an admins application and then started to design the application where me along with my mentor and ameen bro discussed some of the ideas which can be implemented in the apllication which will be practically helpfull when present in the application . Then i went on designing the other pages in the users end and I completed two more pages inside the categories and then it was time for fridays turf and i was not well so  i couldnt get myself involved in the activity .I learnt a few things about animation effect in figma and tried to implement it in my application which was not so good and  i  decided not to have it .I explored many designs and I went through many application designs as possible from my mobile applications and i tried to decode all those applications to learn the method and to  have some clues on how to design an application professionally and practically useful to the users.I created some designs differently just to get familiar with the tools in the figma .I then came back to home.Overall picture of this week was good as i learnt how to think in a proper manner and started to improve my thinkinng starndards where i can improve constantly in order to get better at it .This week was very productive as i learnt to use figma and learnt to design an application from scratch by keeping the requirements of the application in the mind.The most important thing learnt this week was to  keep things as simple as possible and to be efficient with the design .Hopefully ill try to make the following week even more productive .
