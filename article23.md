 	The day started off by learning the basics of code and i learnt some fundementalks about some different types of pages in a application such as static page application and dynamic page application and i learnt about the outline of single page application.I got to know what is a widget and i tried to see some examples of widgets which will be used in flutter to develop an application page. Then there was a task given to me where i was to create a basic page with a title followed eith an image and with some description on that particular page .I was confused in first on how to start coding and i have started learning some basics which are required in order to understand flutter completely and to make a good progress on application development.The main aim for me is to code atleast 5 pages in my application before my intern period ends.
	Then there was today session where We were taught about the datatypes in other programming language.we learnt how to use the int dataype in a program and the syntax of the integer datatypes and so on.We learnt that there is a language called typescript and its syntax was different like "add():number".Here add is function name,arguments are given inside the brackets,number is the return type.We learnt that a fumction has two phases they are "1.Declaration,2.Execution ".If you did not call a function but you wrote even a 100 functions,itnot worth it.Its just a dead body.I learnt that the functions are capable of  returning the output.We learnt that how the objects datatype,to represent a object, the arguments are passed in the {}.The value should be like the a key :value. We werte taught about the string properties,if anything is given between the ""then it is taken as a string.If two function is added it also gives a string value.It does not a give a int or a float or anything.When a two strings are added it is called as string concantination.We were given different examples of the topics above.Hopefully i can make some more progress in to flutter concepts tomorrow.
