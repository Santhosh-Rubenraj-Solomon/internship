	The day started off by starting to reading a new book called Dont make me think and this book is all about how to think in manner with which the user approaches the web page or an mobile application in order to satisfy their need the first chapter tells about the first rule of usability and it is nothing but the web page or a mobile application which we design must be self explanatory and does not need anybody externally to explain the features in our application.Coming to the second chapter is all about on how we use the web application most people will not read the web application fully mostly people will scan the web application looking for what they need,and the main motive for a user and the website developer is to give the information which the user is searching for so that both of them will be satisfied.I read two chapters today in the book and after that i started to explore some popup designs so that i can make my design even more presentable and professional.I got some tips from Arul on how to improvise the existing design and i tried to implement those designs .Then after lunch today i started to  buid an application for the admins version where i must do the paper workd in the first stage and i  collected the requirements ehich are needed to make the applkication fully functionable .I started from the data required to the admins notice so that he can manage the application.The most required data required in the admins end is that week dues or the dues that is in the next 5 working days.The wishlist from the users end must be listed to the admin.The history of the books must be known to the admin so that if there is damage in the future it will be helpful for the admin to  enquire about the damages to that particular person.The admin is the one who can  add or remove an user so that the provision for the updatuion or inclusion of the user name must be available.The admin only has the authority to include or remove a book or category from the library so the required provision must be available.The design of the admins application is on progress hopefully tomorrow it will  be completed.
