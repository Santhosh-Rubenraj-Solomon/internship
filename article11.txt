	The day started off by completing the design clearly on paper.Then in Core Illustrio i started to design the layouts in Figma  which i already did it with paper and pen.After some corrections from my mentor i begun executing the design in figma with some basic rules in my mind.I did only two slides today as i was not really  in the fullest of my potential today. I checked on different designs that can be used or it can be modified a bit so that it can be used in my project.The thing that i learnt today is that the way we design will get better with time and practice .  UI design needs more of exposure which will definitly be helpful for creating user's interface in more interactive and attractive manner.ive learnt some more tolls in figma which will be used by me in the designing process inorder to get a better  outcome of the project.
	Then there was an evening session for which i had travelled to surfboard . The session was interesting today as the topic was about mathematical thinking where we were taught about prepositions,conjunctions,disjunctions.We were made clear about the difference between the preposition statements and  commanding statements with some examples.Truth tables of logical implication and biconditional ststements were taught which was interesting and i had my off time playing some table tennis so that my mind can be refreshed for the next process required to complete the following works for the day.I know i was not upto my potential today and hopefully i can change that around by tomorrow and try to be even more productive than my usual days.
